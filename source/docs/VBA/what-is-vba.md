# Getting Started {#getting-started}

This is a starter template for creating a beautiful, customizable documentation site for your project with minimal effort. You’ll only have to change a few settings and you’re ready to go.

## Configuration {#getting-started-configuration}

As with all Jigsaw sites, configuration settings can be found in `config.php`; you can update the variables in that file with settings specific to your project. You can also add new configuration variables there to use across your site; take a look at the [Jigsaw documentation](http://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/site-variables/) to learn more.
