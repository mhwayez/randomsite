# Algolia DocSearch {#algolia-docsearch}

This starter template includes support for [DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/), a documentation indexing and search tool provided by Algolia for free. To configure this tool, youâ€™ll need to sign up with Algolia and set your API Key and index name in `config.php`. Algolia will then crawl your documentation regularly, and index all your content.
